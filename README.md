# ShoppingCartReact

This is my first full react project that allows the user to add shopping items to a cart. The user can then view their cart and adjust the quantity, while the total amount of items and total cost are updated. 
The frontend makes up a single-paged application in react and it uses an [API backend](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to fetch the products using axios.
